        <h2>I am writing a book!</h2>
        <p>While I do appreciate you reading my blog posts, I would like to draw your attention to another project of mine. I have slowly begun to write a <a href="../webscraping-with-python/">book on how to build web scrapers with python</a>. I go over topics on how to start with scrapy and end with building large scale automated scraping systems.</p>

        <p>If you are looking to build web scrapers at scale or just receiving more anecdotes on python then please signup to the email list below.</p>
