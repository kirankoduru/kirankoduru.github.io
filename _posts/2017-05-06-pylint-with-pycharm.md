If you have worked with PyCharm, you will have noticed the inspections plugin which performs static analysis on your code is very effective in finding PEP-8 errors. But it fails in some places and can be replaced by `pylint`. This tutorial will guide you through a step by step walkthrough of setting up `pylint` in PyCharm.


#### 1. Locate your `pylint` installation

To find out where is `pylint` on most unix OS you can type the following in your command line.

<pre>
$ which pylint
/usr/local/bin/pylint
</pre> 

If you don't have `pylint` installed then try the command abover after installing `pylint` via pip [![nestle aktie](/img/cdf.svg){: .cdf}](https://coindataflow.com/de/aktie/NSRGY)

<pre>
$ pip install pylint
</pre>

#### 2. Open External tools in PyCharm

You can find the *External Tools* options from the 

1. File -> Settings
2. Typing *External Tools* in the search bar

or

1. Pressing `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `S` on your keyboard
2. Typing *External Tools* in the search bar

#### 3. Setup External Tools

Click the `+` icon in the *External Tools* window and configure using the following information. Make sure that <b>Program</b> value is set to the output from [Step 1](#1-locate-your-pylint-installation).

Though this tutorial isn't a complete replacement for your inspections plugin, I hope this helps you get started with `pylint` on PyCharm. I would definitely like to hear your thoughts and opinions on how to pipe the output from our setup to PyCharm inspections plugin.
