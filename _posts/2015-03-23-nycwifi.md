Creating side projects is tough, especially when you keep saying to yourself that you are short on time. Today I would like to present to you a side project that I have been working on for the last couple of days. 

It is about finding free WiFi locations in New York City. And finding them isn't that tough when the city provides you with data about these WiFi locations.

__Built with__: HTML5, jQuery, bootstrap, flat-ui, google maps API
